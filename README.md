# To-Do List

##Description
**Daily To-Do List** is a simple application I built using my skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Users can not only add, edit, and delete tasks, they can also change the state
of their task by utilizing three different lists, to-do, in-progress, and completed. This feature would help users organize their tasks and thoughts clearer by having different styling and 
seeing how many tasks they still have to do, currently working on, and completed throughout the day. 

##Features
